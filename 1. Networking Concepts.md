# **1.4 - Introduction to IP (Internet Protocol)**

## **1. Understanding IP – A Moving Van Analogy**

🚛 IP functions like a **moving van**, efficiently transporting data across networks.

🔹 **The Road = Network Topology** → Ethernet, DSL, cable networks.  
🔹 **The Truck = Internet Protocol (IP)** → The structured system for moving data.  
🔹 **The Boxes = Data Packets** → These hold TCP/UDP segments.  
🔹 **Inside the Boxes = Application Data** → This contains specific information like HTTP requests.

## **2. TCP and UDP – Transport Layer Protocols**

📍 **Both TCP and UDP work at OSI Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**.  
📍 They **encapsulate** data and enable communication between applications.

### **📌 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable Communication**

✔️ **Connection-oriented** – Formal setup and teardown process.  
✔️ **Reliable** – Retransmits lost packets and manages **out-of-order delivery**.  
✔️ **Flow control** – Adjusts the rate of data transfer based on receiver capacity.  
✔️ Used for applications that require **accuracy over speed**.

🔹 **Examples**: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3), file transfers (FTP).

![[Pasted image 20250205100956.png]]

---

### **📌 UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Fast but Unreliable**

⚡ **Connectionless** – No formal session establishment.  
⚡ **Unreliable** – No retransmissions or error correction.  
⚡ **No flow control** – Sender determines the amount of data.  
⚡ Used for applications requiring **speed over reliability**.

🔹 **Examples**: Live video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, DNS lookups.

![[Pasted image 20250205101010.png]]

## **3. IP Addressing & Packet Delivery**

🔹 **Each computer has an IP address** – Just like houses have unique addresses.  
🔹 **Packets must be delivered to the right destination** – Like parcels in a delivery system.  
🔹 **IP delivery** works by **sending data from one IP address to another**.  
🔹 **Port numbers act as room labels** – Ensuring data reaches the correct application.

---

## **4. Understanding Ports – Routing Data to Applications**

📍 Ports help computers differentiate between multiple applications running at the same time.

### **📌 Types of Ports**

🔹 **Non-Ephemeral Ports (Well-Known Ports)** – Permanent, assigned to common services.

- Range: **0 – 1,023**
- Example: **Port 80 (HTTP), Port 443 (HTTPS), Port 25 (SMTP)**

🔹 **Ephemeral Ports (Temporary Ports)** – Assigned dynamically to client devices.

- Range: **1,024 – 65,535**
- Example: **A web browser requesting a website may use port 49152.**

📍 **Port numbers do not provide security** – They simply direct traffic.

---

## **5. Summary**

✅ **IP = The system that moves data across networks**.  
✅ **TCP = Reliable, connection-oriented, ensures data integrity**.  
✅ **UDP = Fast, connectionless, prioritizes speed over reliability**.  
✅ **Port numbers = Help direct network traffic to the correct application**.
