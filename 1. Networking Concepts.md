# Networking 

## **1. What is Networking?**

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and communicate. A network allows devices to exchange data and access shared resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

## **2. Importance of Networking**

- **Resource Sharing** – Allows multiple devices to access shared resources like printers, servers, and storage.
- **Communication** – Enables email, video calls, messaging, and VoIP.
- **Data Transfer** – Facilitates fast and secure transfer of data between devices.
- **Centralized Management** – Simplifies IT operations by managing devices and resources from a central location.
- **Internet Access** – Provides connectivity to the internet for browsing, cloud computing, and online services.

## **3. Types of Networks**

Networks are categorized based on their size and function:

### **A. Based on Size and Coverage**

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
    
    - Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or school.
    - Uses Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or both.
    - Example: A network in a company office.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
    
    - Spans a large geographical area, often across cities or countries.
    - Uses leased telecommunication lines, fiber optics, or satellites.
    - Example: The internet, corporate branch networks.
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
    
    - Covers a city or large campus.
    - Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
    - Example: A city-wide network for public Wi-Fi.
4. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**

---

## **3. Mnemonic to Remember OSI Layers**

To easily remember the layers from **Layer 7 (Application) to Layer 1 (Physical)**, use:

**"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"**  
(A → P → S → T → N → D → P)

Or, from **Layer 1 (Physical) to Layer 7 (Application)**:

**"Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away"**  
(P → D → N → T → S → P → A)

- Ensuring **VoIP calls remain clear even with heavy network traffic**.

---

## **4. Time to Live (TTL)**

### **Definition**

- A **mechanism that limits the lifespan of a packet or cached entry** to prevent network congestion and loops.

### **Key Features**

✅ **Ensures data is available only for a limited time**.  
✅ **Prevents infinite network loops**.  
✅ **TTL is counted in either**:

- **Time-based expiration** (cache expiry).

![[Pasted image 20250205090326.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250205090427.png]]

---

## **5. Routing Loops**

### **Definition**

- A **misconfiguration in routing** where packets are endlessly forwarded between two or more routers.

### **How It Happens**

- **Router A** thinks the next hop is **Router B**.
- **Router B** thinks the next hop is **Router A**.
- The packet **circulates indefinitely**.

### **How TTL Helps Prevent Routing Loops**

- **Each time a packet passes through a router (hop), the TTL decreases by 1**.
- **Once TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet**, preventing endless loops.

### **Common Causes**

- **Static routing misconfigurations**.
- **Incorrect dynamic routing protocol settings** (e.g., OSPF, BGP).

---

## **6. Internet Protocol (IP) and TTL**

### **Definition**

- **IP packets use TTL to avoid being stuck in a loop indefinitely**.

### **Key Features**

✅ **When TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet**.

### **Default TTL Values**

|**Operating System**|**Default TTL (hops)**|
|---|---|
|macOS/Linux|64 hops|
|Windows|128 hops|

---

## **7. Domain Name System (DNS) and TTL**

### **Definition**

- **DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses** (e.g., `www.example.com → 192.168.1.1`).
- Uses **TTL to determine how long an IP address remains cached**.

### **Key Features**

✅ **DNS lookups store IP addresses for a defined period** (TTL duration).  
✅ **Shorter TTL** → Faster updates but increases lookup frequency.  
✅ **Longer TTL** → Reduces lookup load but may cause outdated records.

### **Example**

- `www.professormesser.com` resolves to `172.67.41.114` with a TTL of **300 seconds** (5 minutes).

---

## **Summary Table**

|**Networking Function**|**Purpose**|**Key Features**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|---|

|**IP TTL**|Avoid packet looping|Decrement TTL per hop|Default: Windows (128), Linux (64)|
|**DNS TTL**|Manage cached DNS records|Controls lookup expiration|[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) → IP address|

---

## **Conclusion**

- **CDNs** accelerate content delivery by **caching data closer to users**.
- **VPNs** provide **secure and encrypted communication over public networks**.
- **QoS ensures high-priority applications function smoothly**, even during network congestion.
- **TTL prevents outdated data from persisting** and **stops infinite loops**.

- May lack the **granularity needed for complex environments**.

![[Pasted image 20250205094718.png]]

## **6. Network Security Groups (NSGs)**

✅ **Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)**  
✅ **Individual Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
✅ **Subnet-level traffic (if needed)**

---

## **Key Features of NSGs**

✅ **Granular Security Control** – Unlike **Network Security Lists (ACLs), NSGs allow rule customization** for individual devices.  
✅ **Device-Specific Rules** – Security policies can be applied **to a specific Virtual Network Interface Card (VNIC)** instead of an entire subnet.  
✅ **Inbound & Outbound Traffic Filtering** – NSGs can define **which IPs, ports, and protocols** are allowed or denied.  
✅ **Better Security Best Practices** – Ensures that different devices **in the same IP subnet can have unique security policies**.  
✅ **Improved Security Posture** – Helps prevent **unauthorized access and attacks** by controlling communication between instances.

## **NSG vs. Network Security Lists (ACLs)**

|Feature|**Network Security Group (NSG)**|**Network Security List (ACL)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Applied to **specific VNICs or VMs**|Applied to **entire subnets**|
|**Granularity**|Fine-grained **per-device security**|Broad **subnet-wide security**|
|**Flexibility**|Allows **different rules for devices in the same subnet**|Same security policy for all subnet devices|
|**Best Use Case**|**Securing individual cloud resources** like VMs and applications|**Controlling large network segments**|

---

## **Security Best Practices with NSGs**

🔒 **Apply NSGs to VNICs for granular control** over each virtual machine.  
🔒 **Use NSGs in combination with Network Security Lists (ACLs)** for layered security.

### **📌 Hybrid Cloud**

🔄 **Combination of public and private clouds**.  
🔄 Sensitive data stays **in a private cloud**, while non-critical services run **in the public cloud**.  
🔄 **More flexibility and scalability** while keeping security in check.  
🔄 Complex to manage due to integration challenges.

🔹 **Example**: A business using **AWS for customer-facing applications** and **a private cloud for internal finance systems**.

## **2. Cloud Service Models**

Cloud services are categorized based on the level of control and management.

### **📌 Software as a Service (SaaS)**

📧 Fully managed software applications available **on-demand**.  
📧 No need for installation, maintenance, or infrastructure management.  
📧 Accessible **via web browsers**—no need for local installations.  
📧 **Data is hosted by the provider**, limiting control.

🔹 **Examples**: Google Workspace, Office 365, Dropbox, Salesforce

---

### **📌 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

🖥️ **Virtualized computing resources** (servers, storage, networking).  
🖥️ The provider manages hardware, but **users handle software, security, and configurations**.  
🖥️ **Flexible**—scale up or down as needed.  
🖥️ Requires technical expertise to manage.

🔹 **Examples**: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine

---

### **📌 Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

🔧 Provides **development and deployment tools** without managing infrastructure.  
🔧 Developers can build, test, and deploy applications **without worrying about servers, databases, or networks**.  
🔧 Ideal for software development and rapid prototyping.  
🔧 **Less control over the infrastructure** but offers scalability and efficiency.

🔹 **Examples**: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services, Salesforce

## **3. Choosing the Right Cloud Model**

💡 **For businesses needing a simple, fully managed solution** → **SaaS**  
💡 **For organizations requiring complete control over IT resources** → **IaaS**  
💡 **For developers looking to build applications without managing infrastructure** → **PaaS**  
💡 **For enterprises balancing security and scalability** → **Hybrid Cloud**

---

## **4. Summary**

Cloud computing provides flexibility, cost efficiency, and scalability through **different deployment and service models**. Choosing the right model depends on **business needs, security requirements, and technical expertise**.
