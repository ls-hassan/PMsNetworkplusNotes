# Networking 

## **1. What is Networking?**

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and communicate. A network allows devices to exchange data and access shared resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

## **2. Importance of Networking**

- **Resource Sharing** â€“ Allows multiple devices to access shared resources like printers, servers, and storage.
- **Communication** â€“ Enables email, video calls, messaging, and VoIP.
- **Data Transfer** â€“ Facilitates fast and secure transfer of data between devices.
- **Centralized Management** â€“ Simplifies IT operations by managing devices and resources from a central location.
- **Internet Access** â€“ Provides connectivity to the internet for browsing, cloud computing, and online services.

## **3. Types of Networks**

Networks are categorized based on their size and function:

### **A. Based on Size and Coverage**

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
    
    - Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or school.
    - Uses Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or both.
    - Example: A network in a company office.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
    
    - Spans a large geographical area, often across cities or countries.
    - Uses leased telecommunication lines, fiber optics, or satellites.
    - Example: The internet, corporate branch networks.
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
    
    - Covers a city or large campus.
    - Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
    - Example: A city-wide network for public Wi-Fi.
4. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
